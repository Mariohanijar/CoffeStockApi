This is my first back-end project, developed to manage a coffee shop's inventory efficiently and securely.
The goal of this project is to master the fundamental pillars of modern Java back-end development.

## Project Overview

CoffeeStock is a RESTful API designed to handle the daily operations of a coffee house.
It allows managers to track ingredients, update prices, and manage product availability in real time.

## Tech Stack

- Language: Java 17+
- Framework: Spring Boot 3
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Containerization: Docker & Docker Compose (full environment orchestration)
- Data Persistence: Spring Data JPA / Hibernate
- Documentation: Swagger / OpenAPI (interactive API testing)

## Requirements

To run this project locally, you need the following tools installed:

- Docker (20+)
- Git

> Java and PostgreSQL are **not required locally**.
> The entire environment is managed by Docker Compose.
